Discovering new movies is exciting. Even better if the discovered movies are surprisingly good. I've been playing around with some ideas for generating _better_ recommendations.
By better I mean movies that are very different, yet share the same "hidden qualities" that will make you love them.

The theory behind the recommendations engine is explained [here](https://github.com/manstegling/linkboy/blob/master/doc/DOCUMENTATION.md) and the repo and how to run
locally is available on [Linkboy's GitHub](https://github.com/manstegling/linkboy).


##### Search for a movie

To use the recommendation engine you'll need to refer to movies by their corresponding `movieId`. This can be found using this search functionality.
Simply search for the movie using the whole or a part of the title.

<div>
  <div class="row mb-3">
    <div class="col-8">
      <input type="text" class="form-control" id="query-input" placeholder="Star Wars" onkeydown="enterFindMovie(this)">
    </div>
    <div class="col-4">
	  <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary" id="query-button" onclick="findMovie()">Search</button>
	</div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="overflow-auto mb-3 bg-light" style="max-height: 260px; display: none;" id="searchResult">
  <div class="list-group list-group-flush bg-light" id="searchResultList"></div>
</div>

<div class="row mb-3">
  <div class="col-4">
    <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary" style="display: none;" id="whli-button" onclick="willHeLoveIt()">Will he love it?</button>
  </div>
  <div class="col-8"">
    <div id="whliResult" style="display: none;">
  </div>
</div>

Now let's use those IDs to make some magic happen!

##### Find paths

Taste is dynamic. What you like depends on your frame of reference. To fully appreciate a movie, it may be better to watch some other movies first. If you enter the movieIds of two
movies below you'll get a suggestion on movies to see (in order) to better appreciate the target movie.


<div>
  <div class="row mb-3">
    <div class="col-4">
      <input type="text" class="form-control" id="movieId1" placeholder="260">
    </div>
	<div class="col-4">
      <input type="text" class="form-control" id="movieId2" placeholder="41912"><br>
	</div>
	<div class="col-4">
	  <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary" id="path-button" onclick="postFindPath()">Find</button>
	</div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="overflow-auto mb-3 bg-light" style="max-height: 260px; display: none;" id="pathResult">
  <ul class="list-group list-group-flush bg-light" id="pathResultList"></ul>
</div>

##### Tune the algorithm to your personal taste

The recommendation engine operates on a generic taste profile. To generate better recommendations you can tune it using your own MovieLens ratings. If you're using MovieLens,
navigate to [export your data](https://movielens.org/profile/settings/import-export) and click 'export ratings'. Then upload the resulting file to Linkboy using the file chooser below. You remain entirely
anonymous and the only reference to your tuned recommendations is a randomly generated key.

<div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-8">
      <input class="form-control" type="file" id="file-select">
    </div>
    <div class="col-4">
      <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary" id="tuneButton">Tune</button>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
