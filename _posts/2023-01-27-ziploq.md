Do you work in Java? Ever wanted to merge and seqence data from multiple sources?

![Ziploq; merging input sources](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/manstegling/ziploq/master/images/ziploq.png)

[Ziploq](https://github.com/manstegling/ziploq) is a lightweight message-synchronization device with ultra-high performance. It lets you quickly merge data from any
number of data sources reactively, without having to reach for large frameworks such as _Project Reactor_ or _Akka Streams_. It doesn't matter whether the input
data is ordered or not, the output will always be ordered! When dealing with external systems please note that data transmission delays and disconnections are all
handled automatically out-of-the-box, too!

Ziploq is built with infinite real-time data sequences in mind, but works just as well for in-memory datasets. This design results in a low memory footprint and a high
message throughput. Simple, reliable and fast.
